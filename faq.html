<p style="font-size:13px;">We have you covered!<br> When providing the delivery address, we ask for telephone numbers and we will co ordinate with the receiver to get the delivery done . We can either leave it by the door, on a verandah, by the garage or even with a neighbour.<br> Provide the instructions and so long as it's reasonable, our delivery drivers will do their very best to meet your request.<br> We hope you understand that we are no longer responsible once the order has been left at the designated premises.<br> Alternatively, if the recipient isn't available, our driver will attempt to phone them to schedule a suitable delivery time.</p>
